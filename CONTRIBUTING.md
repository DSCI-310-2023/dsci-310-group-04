Welcome to group-04's dsci-310 project! 

# Here's how you can contribute to this project: 
**Reports**
- **readiability issues**: If any of our installation, coding comments, or steps are unclear, please submit an issue about what was unclear and where you found it. We will try our best to update it if needed, or provide an explanation if appropriate!
- **bugs**: If there are any bugs in the code, we encourage you to figure out how to fix them yourself and explain the post and issue. If you have trouble with fixing it, by all means share the error or situation, and describe the steps you took to get to that. Please make sure descriptions give the exact steps to make things reproducable and easy to follow. Explain why you did things as well so contributors can get a sense of your thought process. 

#### How to file a report:
Questions, reports or comments can be directed towards any of the collaborators through opening issues.
